# TwseInfoApp
- This is a sample stock info application of Taiwan ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼.
- Uses MVVM pattern, Clean architecture principle

### Getting Started 

- Download the repo
- Install dependencies

```dart
flutter pub upgrade
```

### Architecture (MVVM + Clean architecture)

```dart
// Relationship with each part
Screen <-> ViewModel <-> UseCase(Dto) <-> Repository(Model) or DataBase(Entity) 
```

### Screen
- Screen is the collection of visible elements, which also receives user input.

```dart
// File path
/presentation/home/home_screen.dart
```

### ViewModel
- ViewModel is located between the View and Model layers.
```dart
// File path
/presentation/home/home_view_model.dart
```

### Model (Data) 
-   Model houses the logic for the program, which is retrieved by the ViewModel upon its own receipt of input from the user through View.

Components of data layer include:
- __model__

  -__dto__: Defines dto of ui model, also perform data transformation between ```domain```, ```response``` and ```entity``` models.

  -__local__: Defines the schema of SQLite database.

  -__remote__: Defines data of network responses.

- __local__: This is responsible for performing caching operations using [Drift](https://pub.dev/packages/drift).

- __remote__: This is responsible for performing network operations.

- __repository__: Responsible for exposing data to the domain layer.

```dart
// Folder
/data/local
/data/remote
/data/model/dto
/data/repository
```

### Utils 
- Any additional helpers or strings are put inside the utils
```dart
// File path
/utils/string_ext.dart
```

### Testing 
- Unit tests of repository tests and view model tests

```dart
// Folder path
/test/repo
/test/view_model
```

- Integration tests
```dart
// Folder path
/integration_test/robots
/integration_test/app_test.dart
```

- Run the cmd

```dart
flutter test --coverage

flutter drive \
--driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart \
--target=integration_test/app_test.dart
```
